    <div class="date">december 21, 2019</div>
    
    <p>
        so the decade is coming to an end and there was a lot of great music this decade!
        music has always been one of my favorite art forms and one of my favorite hobbies 
        is listening to new music and talking about it with friends. these were some of 
        my favorites albums, in no particular order (click the image to expand). 
    
    <a href="/img/decade.jpg"><img src="/img/decade.jpg"></a>

    <p>
        i don't think i could rank these albums but i could elaborate more on my top 5:
    </p>

    <h3>Anderson .Paak — <i>Malibu</i> (2016)</h3>
    <img class="album" src="/img/malibu.JPG">
    <p>
        Anderson .Paak's charisma and energy is infectious in <i>Malibu</i>. track after 
        track he flexes his incredible vocal range over some warm instrumentals. is blends
        west coast hip hop — guest appearances include Rapsody, Schoolboy Q, and The Game 
        — as well as r&b and neo-soul. one of the things i especially admire about this 
        album is how expansive its feature list and production credits list are. it's 
        definitely an album that couldn't have come together so well if it wasn't for the
        work of a lot of people. and that's not to deminish Anderson .Paak's 
        contributions; he's a commanding prescence and his subject matter tends to lean
        very personal. this album is a consistently feel-good and fun listen.

        favorite tracks: "The Season / Carry Me", "Parking Lot", "The Dreamer",
        "Heart Don't Stand a Chance", "The Bird".

    <h3>Alvvays — <i>Alvvays</i> (2014)</h3>
    <img class="album" src="/img/alvvays.JPG">
    <p>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/alvvaysband">Alvvays</a> — pronounced "always" — is 
        a canadian indie pop band and their debut self-titled album was one of the best 
        first listens i've ever had to an album. the album takes musical inspiration from
        subgenres like surf rock, dream pop, and shoegaze which makes for a lush and 
        ethereal sonic pallette. while the production is rather easy-going, the lyrics 
        offer themes of  social anxiety and longing. one interesting thing about the 
        lyrics is lead singer Molly Rankin sings them in a very direct manner in that 
        these songs are written <i>addressing</i> someone which makes them even more 
        personal and relatable. this combination makes for a blissful, pensive, and 
        catchy listen.

        favorite tracks: "Ones Who Love You", "Party Police", "Dives", "Atop a Cake", 
        "Archie, Marry Me".

    <h3>Abra — <i>Rose</i> (2015)</h3>
    <img class="album" src="/img/abra-rose.jpeg">
    <p>
        <a href="https://twitter.com/abra">Abra</a> is part of atlanta group 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/awfulrecords?lang=en">awful records</a> and while 
        they have a lot of talent on their roster, i think she is my favorite artist on 
        the label. <i>Roses</i> is self-produced album full of spacey and lowkey tracks 
        combining r&b, synthpop, and uk bass. she has a really great voice which goes 
        over really well over the DIY 80s r&b revival and darkwave production. this is a 
        very appealing combination as she is able to incorporate bright vocal samples 
        into her otherwise moody instrumentals. lyrically, Abra writes intimate and 
        vulnarable lyrics filled with metaphors. the last two songs on the album  are 
        stripped back remakes of previous songs which include skeletal piano  
        instrumentals and this is where she <i>really</i> showcases her vocal talent.

        favorite tracks: "Roses", "Atoms", "Feel", "No Chill", "Human".

    <h3>Ratking — <i>So it Goes</i> (2014)</h3>
    <img class="album" src="/img/soitgoes.JPG">
    <p>
        i discovered hip hop trio Ratking right as they broke up. such a shame because on 
        <i>So it Goes</i>, they demonstrate such a unique blend of new york hip hop in my
        opinion. their influences are varied: the album is as grimey as any new york 
        album in the 90s but you can also hear how rapper
        <a href="https://twitter.com/wikset">Wiki</a> takes inspiration from acts like Rage
        against the Machine and Ol Dirty Bastard while producer
        <a href="https://sportinglife.bandcamp.com/">Sporting Life</a> looks at both hip 
        hop producers RZA and Madlib as well as indie bands like Animal Collective. 
        not to mention the really sharp lyricism and storytelling by both Wiki and Hak. 
        it's a modern take on classic 90s new york boom bap. 
    </p>

    <p>
        favorite tracks: "*", "Canal", "Protein", "Cocoa '88", "So Sick Stories".

    <h3>Mach-Hommy — <i>HBO</i> (2016)</h3>
    <img class="album" src="/img/hbo.JPG">
    <p>
        Mach-Hommy is a rapper from new jersey making innovative east coast hip hop.
        he has this off-kilter flow and delivery which when paired with lo-fi production,
        makes his  voice sound grimey and distorted. he's idiosyncratic, often choosing 
        to rap off beat but not too off beat  that it's awkard. it took me a bit of time 
        to get into this album but the clever  wordplay and lyricism as well as the dusty
        and abstract instrumentals from producers 
        <a href="https://augustfanon.bandcamp.com/">August Fanon </a> and 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/Daringer_">Daringer</a> make this album very 
        captivating. a special mention to guest appearances from buffalo poet
        <a href="https://twitter.com/Keisha_Plum">Keisha Plum</a> and buffalo rapper 
        <a href="https://twitter.com/WHOISCONWAY">Conway</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        favorite tracks: "Ti Geralde", "1080p", "Kapeesh", "Bey Six", "Thank God".
