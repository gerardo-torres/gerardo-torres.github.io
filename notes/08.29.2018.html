    <h2>ultra chat</h2>
    
    <p>i've been learning a little bit about websockets and wanted to make a small project with this technology. a chat app is a perfect project to do for websockets since they're a very common feature in a lot of user-facing products. additionally, it's a problem that can be solved with in multiple scales: ranging from a very simple websockets-based approach (which i am currently doing) to a production-ready app with security, realiability, and user-friendlyness in mind. </p>

    <p>i wanted to have a cool UI but i realized that having a chat app in your terminal is probably cooler and would require
    less resources.</p>

    <p>the above GIF shows an example between two users: alice & bob. there exists a single chatroom for now but in the future i hope to add the ability to create multiple chatrooms with different admin and member privalages.</p>

    <p>i used javascript and node js to build this with sockets.io as the websocket library as well as mongo db as the database to store user information.</p>
