    <h2>ascend educational fund (AEF) gala</h2>

    <div class="date">april 14, 2018</div>

    <p>
        last month i had the amazing opportunity to give a short speech at the 
        <a href="">ascend educational fund (AEF)</a> 2018 gala. AEF is an nyc 
        scholarship aimed at helping immigrant students and children of immigrants help
        pay for college and provide them with mentorship to succeed in higher education.
        the gala was for fundraising event for next year's class of scholars.
    </p>

    <p>
        i talked a little bit about my journey being an immigrant from Mexico and making
        it through to get into college as well as how the scholarship gave me a sense of 
        community and helped make school affordable. here's some photos!
